/*Create a map for students and GitHub usernames

Create a class named GradesApplication with a main method. Inside the main method,
 create a HashMap named students. It should have keys that are strings that
 represent github usernames, and values that are Student objects. Create at least
 4 student objects with at least 3 grades each, and add them to the map.

Be creative! Make up GitHub usernames and grades for your student objects.*/



/*Create the command line interface

Print the list of GitHub usernames out to the console, and ask the user which
student they would like to see more information about. The user should enter a
GitHub username (i.e. one of the keys in your map). If the given input does not
match up with a key in your map, tell the user that no users with that username
were found. If the given username does exist, display information about that
student, including their name and their grades.

After the information is displayed, the application should ask the user if they want
 to continue, and keep running so long as the answer is yes.*/
